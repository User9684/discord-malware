### QnA

- Q: How do I add this malware to a fake game?
- A: Go fuck yourself
- Q: How does this malware avoid detection?
- A: Antivirus vendors tend to improperly detect the rune array as a base64, and thus assume its a binary when in reality its just a basic javascript payload
- Q: How could Discord fix this?
- A: Discord could fix this type of malware, along with almost all other variants, by simply shipping electron with `webContents.executeJavaScript` removed
- Q: What is `webContents.executeJavaScript`?
- A: `executeJavaScript` is an electron function that allows the client to execute non-compiled JS at runtime, rather than just executing compiled JS into the app. This is not needed due to the fact that executing JS that isn't compiled into the app is insanely bad practice.
